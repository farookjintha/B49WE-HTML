        Spotify Wrapped is one of the music streaming app's most successful
        content marketing campaigns. Near the end of every year, Spotify users
        get a fun roundup of all the music they've listened to that year. The
        roundup is broken down into genres, years, artists, and more, and is
        displayed with brightly colored graphics. It then creates a personalized
        playlist of the user's most listened to songs, and users have the option
        to share their wrapped playlists on social media — a key element that
        has made the campaign to trend on social media every year since its
        inception. You likely know DuoLingo as the website and app that helps
        users learn a new language, but the company has generated buzz on TikTok
        for another reason — the company's self-proclaimed "unhinged" mascot.
        DuoLingo has amassed over 4.5 million followers on TikTok thanks to its
        consistent stream of content featuring the company's iconic green owl
        mascot.
